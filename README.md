## About

For our final project as part of the Northcoders bootcamp, me and 2 other students created this app. It was inspired by the covid pandemic and allows users to post ads about the type of walk and person they're looking for. For example, if they have kids, dogs, or just fancy a friendly chat with someone.

## Tech Used

To build the app we used a number of technologies, some old and some familiar. These included:

- React
- Firebase / Firestore Database
- CSS
- Google Maps & Places APIs
- Talk JS
